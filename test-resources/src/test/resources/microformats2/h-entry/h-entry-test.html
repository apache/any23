        <p class="p-summary">Last week the microformats.org community 
            celebrated its 7th birthday at a gathering hosted by Mozilla in 
            San Francisco and recognized accomplishments, challenges, and 
            opportunities.</p>

        <p>The microformats tagline “humans first, machines second” 
            forms the basis of many of our 
				<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/principles">principles</a>, and 
            in that regard, we’d like to recognize a few people and 
            thank them for their years of volunteer service </p>
