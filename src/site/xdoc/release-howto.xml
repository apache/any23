    <section name="Prerequisites">
      <ul>
        <li>Install/Configure <code>GPG</code> - The artifacts that are deployed to the ASF central repository need to
        be signed. To do this you will need to have a public and private keypair. There is a very good
        <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/">guide</a> that will
        walk you though this.</li>

        <li>Install the latest version of <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache Maven</a>.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>We highly recommend that you follow this
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">guide</a> to set your master password and
        use it to encrypt your ASF password in the next section.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="ASF settings">
        <p>Using the instructions from the previous step encrypt your Sonatype password and add the following servers to
        your <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file. You may already have other servers in this file. If not just create
        the file.</p>

    <section name="Release steps">
      <subsection name="Prepare the source for release">
        <ol>
          <li>Clean up JIRA so the <b>Fix Version</b> in issues resolved since the last release includes this release
          version correctly. Also, transition any <b>Resolved</b> issues to the <b>Closed</b> state.
          </li>
          <li> Update the text files in a working copy of the project root:
            <ol>
              <li>Update the <tt>RELEASE-NOTES.md</tt> based on the text release reports from JIRA.</li>
              <li>Review and update <tt>README.md</tt> if needed.</li>
              <li>Review and update dates in <tt>NOTICE.txt</tt> if needed.</li>
              <li>Commit any changes back to Git: <pre>git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m "updating files for release"</pre>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Perform a full build and deploy the SNAPSHOT artifacts: <pre>mvn clean deploy</pre></li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Get source tree">
        <ol>
          <li><strong><em>Only for new major releases (like 1.0.0 to 1.1.0):</em></strong>
          <br/>
          Create a sub-branch from which to make the release.
          <br/>
          Releasing from a branch will allow any cosmetic changes that need to be made for the release to be 
          approved to be done without preventing other more disruptive advances in the trunk from potentially 
          causing problems with the release. It also provides a future maintenance branch (like 1.0.x.)
          <br/>
          A branch can be made by running:
          <pre>mvn release:branch -DbranchName=1.0.x</pre></li>
          <li>Checkout a clean copy of the trunk/branch to release using command line Git:
          <pre>git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/any23.git</pre></li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Prepare the release">
        <ol>
          <li>Do a dry run of the <tt>release:prepare</tt> step.
          <pre>mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true</pre>

          The dry run will not commit any changes back to SVN and gives you the opportunity to verify that the 
          release process will complete as expected.

          <p><em>If you cancel a <tt>release:prepare</tt> before it updates the pom.xml versions, then use the 
          <tt>release:clean</tt> goal to just remove the extra files that were created.</em></p></li>

          <li>Verify that the release process completed as expected:
            <ol>
              <li>The release plugin will create <code>pom.xml.tag</code> files which contain the changes that would
              have been committed to SVN. The only differences between <code>pom.xml.tag</code> and its corresponding 
              <code>pom.xml</code> file should be the version
              number.</li>

              <li>If other formatting changes have been made you should review the changes and then commit them:
              <pre>git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m "fixing formatting for release"</pre></li>

              <li>Assuming the <code>.tag</code> files look OK you may proceed and do any other validation you feel
              necessary. The following list may be helpful:
                <ol>
                  <li>Check <tt>release.properties</tt> and make sure that the scm properties have the right version.
                  Sometimes the scm location can be the previous version not the next version.</li>

                  <li>Verify signatures: On Un*x platforms the following command can be executed:
<source>for file in `find . -type f -iname '*.asc'`
do
  gpg --verify ${file}
done</source>

                  You'll need to look at the output to ensure it contains only good signatures:
<source>gpg: Good signature from ...
gpg: Signature made ...</source>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>Once any failures or required updates have been committed to git, rollback the release prepare files:
              <source>mvn release:rollback</source></li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Run the <tt>release:prepare</tt> step for real this time. You'll be prompted for the same version
          information and optionally your GPG passphrase again. <pre>mvn release:prepare</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Perform the release">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the directory where you have launched <tt>release:prepare</tt> execute (this step will create a maven staging repository):
            <source>mvn release:perform [-Duser.name=&lt;your_apache_uid&gt;]</source>

            <p>
              <em>If your local OS userid doesn't match your Apache userid, then you'll have to also override the value 
                provided by the OS to Maven for the site-deploy step to work. This is known to work for Linux, 
                but not for Mac and unknown for Windows.
              </em>
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Verify the staged artifacts in the Nexus repository:

          good idea to rollback the release if a <code>-1</code> vote is received
          (see "Recovering from a vetoed release" below).</li>

          <li>After the vote has been open for at least 72 hours, has at least three +1 PMC votes and no -1 votes, then
