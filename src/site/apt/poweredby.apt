  This page collects a set of project and web initiatives which use <Apache Any23>.

  and offered Search and Querying across this data, updated live every few minutes.

  {{{http://webdatacommons.org/}WebDataCommons}}

  Extracting Structured Data from the Common Web Crawl.
  More and more websites have started to embed structured data describing products, 
  people, organizations, places, events into their HTML pages. The Web Data Commons
  project extracts this data from several billion web pages and provides the extracted 
  data for download. Web Data Commons thus enables you to use the data without needing 
  to crawl the Web yourself.

  {{{http://nutch.apache.org}Apache Nutch}}

  Apache Nutch is a well matured, production ready Web crawler. Nutch enables fine 
  grained configuration, relying on Apache Hadoop data structures, which are 
  great for batch processing.
  Nutch uses Any23 within it's plugin infrastructure to extract structured data markup
  from Webpages. This data can then be indexed into one of the Nutch supported storage
  mechanisms.
