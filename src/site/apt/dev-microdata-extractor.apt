Microdata Extractor

  The <<Microdata>> extractor is compliant with the <<W3C>> draft specification at
  {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/}http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/}}.

  Such extractor produces an RDF representation of the detected Microdata 
  within an <<XHTML5>> document, following the algorithm at section
  {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#rdf}http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#rdf}}.

  It is possible to retrieve the <<JSON>> representation of the same Microdata as defined
  at section {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#json}http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#json}}
  by using the Microdata commandline tool,
  see {{{./getting-started.html#any23tools_script}Getting Started - Apache Any23 Tools}}.
