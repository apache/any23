Build Apache Any23 from sources

    This page describes how to build <<Apache Any23>>.
 
* Access a Snapshot Version

    For the latest snapshot please checkout the code from the public Git repository and build the library.
    Checkout the code from Github:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/any23.git
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Build <<Apache Any23>>

    The following instructions describe how to build the library with {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven 3.x.y+}}.
    For specific information about Maven see: {{{http://maven.apache.org/}}}
    Go to the any23 folder:

+-----------
$ cd any23/
+-----------

    and execute the following command:

+-----------
any23$ mvn clean install
+-----------

    This will install the <<Apache Any23>> artifact and its dependencies in your local M2 repository.

* Generate Documentation

    To generate the project site locally execute the following command from the any23 dir:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
any23$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mvn clean site
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can speed up the site generation process specifying the offline option ( -o ),
    but it works only if all the involved plugin dependencies has been already downloaded
    in the local M2 repository:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
any23$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mvn -o clean site
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you're interested in generating the Javadoc enriched with navigable UML graphs, you can activate
    the umlgraphdoc profile. This profile relies on {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}Graphviz}} that must be
    installed in your system.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
any23$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx256m' mvn -P umlgraphdoc clean site
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
