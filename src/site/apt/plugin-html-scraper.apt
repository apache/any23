HTML Scraper Plugin

  The HTML Scraper Plugin is meant to scrape any HTML page extracting human readable text only.
  Such plugin will generate a set of triples like:

+-----------------
<http://source-page-url> <http://vocab.sindice.net/pagecontent/de>  "<DE  Extractor Result>" .
<http://source-page-url> <http://vocab.sindice.net/pagecontent/ae>  "<AE  Extractor Result>" .
<http://source-page-url> <http://vocab.sindice.net/pagecontent/lce> "<LCE Extractor Result>" .
<http://source-page-url> <http://vocab.sindice.net/pagecontent/ce>  "<CE  Extractor Result>" .
+-----------------

  The plugin engine is based on the {{{http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/} Boilerpipe}} library extractor.
  The extractors mentioned as <<DE>>, <<AE>>, <<LCE>> and <<CE>> are the ones defined within the library.
