        <span class="fn org">Crepes on Cole</span> is one of the best little
        creperies in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">San Francisco</span></span>.
        Excellent food and service. Plenty of tables in a variety of sizes
        for parties large and small. Window seating makes for excellent
        people watching to/from the N-Judah which stops right outside.
        I've had many fun social gatherings here, as well as gotten
        plenty of work done thanks to neighborhood WiFi.
