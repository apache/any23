# Community

You can reach our and connect with our community on our [mailing lists](http://any23.apache.org/mail-lists.html)

# Build Any23 from Source Code

The canonical Any23 source code lives at the [Apache Software Foundation Git repository](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/any23.git).

Be sure to have the [Apache Maven v.3.x+](http://maven.apache.org/) installed and included in $PATH.

## Clone the source:
```
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/any23.git
```
## Navigate and build:
```
cd any23
mvn clean install
```
From now on the above directory **any23** is refered to as **$ANY23_HOME**
This will install the Any23 artifacts and its dependencies in your 
local Maven3 repository.
You can then extract the compiled code and use the command line interface
Please note you will need to change the version to the tar or zip you are extracting.
```
tar -zxvf $ANY23_HOME/cli/target/apache-any23-cli-${version-SNAPSHOT}.tar.gz
```
# Run the Any23 Commandline Tools

Any23 comes with some command line tools. Within the directory you just extracted, you can invoke:
Linux
```  
$ANY23_HOME/cli/target/apache-any23-cli-${version-SNAPSHOT}/bin/any23       
# Provides the main Any23 use case: metadata extraction on a file or URL source.
```
Windows
```
$ANY23_HOME/cli/target/apache-any23-cli-${version-SNAPSHOT}/bin/any23.bat      
# Provides the main Any23 use case: metadata extraction on a file or URL source.
```
The complete documentation about these tools can be found [here](http://any23.apache.org/getting-started.html)

The bin scripts are generated dynamically during the package phase.
To ensure the package generation, from the top level directory run:
```
mvn package
```
You can void extracting the archive files by going to the cli generated bin folder
```
cd  $ANY23_HOME/cli/target/appassembler/bin/
```
and finally invoke the script for your OS (UNIX or Windows):
```
  bin$ ./any23
```
usage instructions will be printed out.

# Run the Any23 Web Service

Any23 can be run as a service. 
To run the Any23 service go to the service dir
and then invoke the embedded Jetty server
```
cd $ANY23_HOME/service
mvn jetty:run
```
You can check the service is running by accessing [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) with your browser.

The complete documentation about this service can be found [here](http://any23.apache.org/getting-started.html)

# Build the Any23 Web Service WAR

The Any23 Service WAR by default will be generated as self-contained, all the dependencies will be included as JAR within the WEB-INF/lib archive dir.

To generate the self contained WAR invoke from the service dir:
```
service$ mvn [-o] [-Dmaven.test.skip=true] clean package
```
Where -o will build the process offline, and -Dmaven.test.skip=true
will force the test skipping.

The WAR will be generated in
```
$ANY23_HOME/service/target/any23-service-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.war
```
To produce a instead a WAR WITHOUT the included JAR dependencies it is possible to use
the war-without-deps profile:
```
any23-service$ mvn [-o] [-Dmaven.test.skip=true] clean package
```
The option [-o] will speed up the module build if you have already
collected all the required dependencies.

The option [-Dmaven.test.skip=true] will disable tests.

Again the various versions of the WAR will be generated into
```
$ANY23_HOME/service/target/apache-any23-service-x.y.z-*
```

## Any23 Web Service Tracker Disclaimer

The Any23 Web Service form (service/src/main/resources/form.html) contains a Google Analytics Tracker which is
by default configured to report to the Any23 Community. It is possible to change the user ID modifying the
```form.tracker.id``` property in parent POM.

# Generate the Documentation

To generate the project site locally execute the following command from $ANY23_HOME:
```
cd $ANY23_HOME
MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mvn [-o] clean site:site
```
You can speed up the site generation process specifying the offline option [-o],
but it works only if all the involved plugin dependencies has been already downloaded
in the local M2 repository.

If you're interested in generating the Javadoc enriched with navigable UML graphs, you can activate
the umlgraphdoc profile. This profile relies on [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) that must be 
installed in your system.
```
cd $ANY23_HOME
MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mvn -P umlgraphdoc clean site:site
```

# Munging of Any23 code to ASF

When it was [decided](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/Any23Proposal) that the Any23 code be brought into the Apache Incubator, the existing code was migrated over to the ASF infrastructure and documented/managed via a number of Jira tickets e.g, [INFRA-3978](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-3978) [INFRA-4146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4146) and [ANY23-29](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ANY23-29).
