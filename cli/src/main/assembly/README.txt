  Installing Apache Any23
  ----------------

** Windows 2000/XP

  1) Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. apache-any23-${project.version}-bin.zip to the directory you wish to
        install Apache Any23 ${project.version}.
        These instructions assume you chose C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation.
        The subdirectory apache-any23-${project.version} will be created from the archive.

  2) Add the ANY23_HOME environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause),
        selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding the ANY23_HOME
        variable in the user variables with the value
        C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-any23-${project.version}.

  3) In the same dialog, add the ANY23 environment variable in the user variables with the value %ANY23_HOME%\bin.

  4) Optional: In the same dialog, add the EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS environment variable in the user variables to specify
        JVM properties, e.g. the value -Xms256m -Xmx512m. This environment variable can be used to supply extra options.
        By default, it is set to: -Xms500m -Xmx500m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit

  5) In the same dialog, update/create the Path environment variable in the user variables and prepend the value
        %ANY23% to add Apache Any23 available in the command line.

  6) In the same dialog, make sure that JAVA_HOME exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is
        set to the location of your JDK, e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02 and that %JAVA_HOME%\bin is in your Path
        environment variable.

  7) Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run any23 --version to verify that it is correctly installed.

** Unix-based Operating Systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)

  1) Extract the distribution archive, i.e. apache-any23-${project.version}-bin.tar.gz to the directory you wish to
        install Apache Any23 ${project.version}.
        These instructions assume you chose /usr/local/apache-any23.
        The subdirectory apache-any23-${project.version} will be created from the archive.

  2) In a command terminal, add the ANY23_HOME environment variable, e.g.
        export ANY23_HOME=/usr/local/apache-any23/apache-any23-${project.version}.

  3) Add the ANY23 environment variable, e.g. export ANY23=$ANY23_HOME/bin.

  4) Optional: Add the EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS environment variable to specify JVM properties, e.g.
        export EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m".
        This environment variable can be used to supply extra options.

  5) Add ANY23 environment variable to your path, e.g. export PATH=$ANY23:$PATH.

  6) Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK, e.g.
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_02 and that $JAVA_HOME/bin is in your PATH environment variable.

  7) Run any23 --version to verify that it is correctly installed.
